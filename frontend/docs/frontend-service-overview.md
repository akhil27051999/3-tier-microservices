# üì¶ Frontend Microservice ‚Äì Containerization Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide for understanding the frontend microservice and containerizing it using Docker.

---

## üìÅ Directory Structure

The `frontend/` directory contains the following files:

| File/Folder     | Purpose                                                           |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `app.js`       | Main React/HTML/JS application logic and UI rendering.            |
| `package.json` | Project metadata and dependencies. Defines how the app should start. |
| `Dockerfile`   | Instructions to build a Docker image for the frontend service.    |

## üê≥ Docker Containerization of Frontend Microservice

Follow the steps below to build and run the frontend microservice inside a Docker container.

---

### Step 1: Navigate to the Frontend Directory

```bash
cd frontend/
```

### Step 2: Write Dockerfile for Frontend Microservice

**Step by Step Explaination**

`FROM node:18-alpine`
- Uses the official Node.js v18 image based on Alpine Linux, a lightweight and secure base image perfect for frontend apps.
`WORKDIR /app`
- Sets the working directory in the container to /app. All commands and file paths after this will be relative to this directory.
`COPY package*.json ./`
- Copies package.json and package-lock.json into the container. These files define the application's dependencies.
`RUN npm install`
- Installs all required Node.js dependencies listed in package.json.
`COPY . .`
- Copies the remaining application source code into the container.
`EXPOSE 3000`
- Informs Docker that the container will listen on port 3000. This is commonly used by frontend dev servers (e.g., React).
`CMD ["npm", "start"]`
- Specifies the command to run the application. It starts the frontend server using the start script from package.json.
  
### Step 3 : Build the Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t frontend-service .
```

### Step 4 : Run the Docker Container

```bash
docker run -d \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --name frontend-container \
  frontend-service
```
- `-d`: Run container in detached mode
- `-p 3000:3000`: Expose port 3000 to access the frontend app via http://localhost:3000
- `--name frontend-container`: Name the container for easier management
- `frontend-service`: Docker image built in Step 2


### Step 5: Verify Frontend is Running

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000
```
