## üèóÔ∏è What is Kubernetes (K8s)?
- Kubernetes is an open-source platform to automate deploying, scaling, and managing containerized applications.
- It manages our Docker containers across multiple hosts, ensuring our app is highly available and scalable.
- Think of Kubernetes as the orchestrator that runs and manages our containers in production.

## Why Kubernetes?
- Handles deployment, scaling, and updates automatically.
- Manages container health and restarts failed containers.
- Provides load balancing and service discovery.
- Manages persistent storage and configuration.

## What We Need Before Starting
1. Docker images pushed to a container registry (Docker Hub or AWS ECR).
2. Kubernetes cluster (we will set it up on your AWS VM or use a managed Kubernetes service).
3. kubectl CLI tool installed to interact with Kubernetes cluster

## Step 1: Installing Kubernetes CLI Tools

### Tool-1: kubectl

**What is kubectl?**

kubectl is the official Kubernetes CLI (Command Line Interface) tool that allows you to interact with your Kubernetes cluster. It's like git for Kubernetes ‚Äî everything from deploying applications to inspecting pods happens through this tool.

**Why do we install kubectl?**
1. To apply YAML manifests (e.g., Deployment, Service files).
2. To inspect and debug resources like pods, services, and logs.
3. To execute commands inside pods for testing connectivity.

```bash
curl -LO "https://dl.k8s.io/release/$(curl -s https://dl.k8s.io/release/stable.txt)/bin/linux/amd64/kubectl"
chmod +x kubectl
sudo mv kubectl /usr/local/bin/
kubectl version --client
```
---
### Tool-2: kind (Kubernetes in Docker)

**What is kind?**

kind stands for Kubernetes IN Docker. It lets us run a full Kubernetes cluster locally using Docker containers as nodes. It's fast and ideal for development and testing purposes.

**Why use kind?**
1. Lightweight and runs without needing a cloud provider.
2. Ideal for local testing of multi-service applications.
3. Works well with kubectl, so we can use standard Kubernetes YAML files.

```bash
curl -Lo ./kind https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/latest/kind-linux-amd64
chmod +x ./kind
sudo mv ./kind /usr/local/bin/kind
kind version
```
### Creating a Cluster with Kind

```bash
kind create cluster --name 3tier-cluster
```
This creates:

- A Kubernetes control plane node inside a Docker container.
- Networking between services and pods.
- we can now access the cluster using kubectl because kind automatically configures the context.

### Verify the Cluster

```bash
kubectl cluster-info
kubectl get nodes
```

**Expected output:**

- One control-plane node listed as Ready.
- Kubernetes API server endpoint shown in cluster-info.
